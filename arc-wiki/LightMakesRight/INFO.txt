Light Makes Right v0.1

This is a simple ray tracer written in Arc.

Running it:

Install the version of Arc available on github by executing the following command:

git clone git://github.com/nex3/arc.git

Startup Arc.  Enter the following commands at the Arc prompt:

arc> (load "YourArcPath/LightMakesRight/lmr.arc")
...output...
arc> (render "YourArcPath/LightMakesRight/demo.lmr")

Wait a while for the render to complete.  You will see numbers printing out in increasing order as scanlines are rendered.  When it is done, you will find a file 'demo.bmp' in your root Arc directory (not in the LightMakesRight directory!)  This name is derived from the 'name' entry in demo.lmr.

Light Makes Right (lmr) offers the following features:

* Phong model lighting
* Multiple point lights
* 4x Super-sampling
* Choice of any shape you wish, as long as it is a sphere or a plane
* Shadows, reflections, refraction
* Procedurally generated checkerboard texture

The following things should be fixed or added:

* Speed.
* Camera needs to be able to 'look at' any point in the scene.
* Camera nees to allow for differing FOV (field of view).
* Support for different primitives.
* Importing objects using a standard format.

Share and enjoy!  If you improve it, let me know.
