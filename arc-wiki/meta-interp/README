I was reading Steele and Sussman's The Art of the Interpreter the other
day and just for the heck of it I decided to try to convert the example
metacircular interpreters described there to Arc.  It turns out to be
simple and enlightening to write an interpreter of Arc in Arc itself.

The four source files here are as follows:

 o mk1.arc - a very simple interpreter which has no free variables but
   defined functions.
 o mk2.arc - an interpreter which provides dynamic binding of free
   variables.
 o mk3.arc - an interpreter which provides static/lexical binding of
   free variables.  This is a pure functional implementation
 o mk4.arc - the mk3 interpreter with support for side effects using
   the set special form

The interpreters here essentially follow the exposition in the Art of
the Interpreter.
